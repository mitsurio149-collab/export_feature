    -> AdvisorInput

NOTHING ELSE.

This module performs no computation, no scoring, no forecasting. It is a
pure projection layer: it reads fields that the deterministic engines have
already produced and copies them into the flat, closed AdvisorInput shape
defined in advisor_contract.py. If a value isn't already sitting on one of
the six input objects, this builder cannot produce it -- that's the point.

Why this exists as its own file, rather than building AdvisorInput inline
wherever it's needed: every route or service that wants to call the
NarrativeService needs the *same* projection, built the *same* way, every
time. Centralizing it here means there is exactly one place that defines
"what facts the AI is allowed to see," which is the property the whole
AI Advisor design depends on.
