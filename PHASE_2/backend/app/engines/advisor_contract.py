"""
AI Advisor contract.

Design goal (per Sprint Intelligence Workflow doc):
    "The AI NEVER computes metrics. The AI NEVER forecasts.
     The AI NEVER generates recommendations independently.
     It ONLY explains deterministic outputs."

This file makes that boundary structural rather than advisory:

1. AdvisorInput is a closed, read-only snapshot. It contains no engines,
   no ProjectState, nothing callable -- only values and evidence that
   upstream engines already computed. The AI literally cannot reach
   anything it could use to compute a new number.

2. AdvisorOutput cannot contain a bare number written by the model.
   Every numeric claim is a `ClaimRef` -- a pointer into AdvisorInput's
   field paths. The renderer resolves the pointer to the *real* value
   at render time. If the model points at a path that doesn't exist,
   resolution fails and that claim is dropped (or the whole response
   falls back to the deterministic template) -- the model can never
   inject a number that didn't already exist in the deterministic layer.

This means: AI gets creative with phrasing and structure (which evidence
to lead with, how to group trade-offs, tone), but it cannot be the
source of any fact in the final text.
